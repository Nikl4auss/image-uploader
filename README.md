This project is a solution to the Image Uploader challenge from devChallenges.io.
You can upload any image as long its type is jpge, png or svg. Images are uploaded to Cloudinary.
Overall I would say that this project was Ok, I didn't fell that my skills where challenged most of the time, although I did need to learn
about Drag & Drop events and how to handle them.
