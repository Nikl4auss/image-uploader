<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

<img src="./public/images/desktop-preview.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
<br />

This project is a solution to the Image Uploader challenge from devChallenges.io.
You can upload any image as long its type is jpge, png or svg. Images are uploaded to Cloudinary.
Overall I would say that this project was Ok, I didn't fell that my skills where challenged most of the time, although I did need to learn
about Drag & Drop events and how to handle them.
